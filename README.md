# Random Investor Report
A script that upon execution generates randomized values for the investor's depot performance, then generates randomized phrases based on it. I built this project to learn a bit more about Git and GitHub, as I used Git to version-control this project, even though it was quite small to begin with. That being said, I hit some roadblocks along the way still and was very positively surprised with the convenience Git offered in returning to previous commits.

## Features:
- generate a randomized depot performance based on elements in the corresponding array.
- uses Math.random() together with a min and max argument to specify a range of indices to randomly generate a fitting phase from, depending on the depot's performance.
- give back those values from the assignment function as an array and re-use the array in the function logging the performance report to the console.

## How to Use:
Since there are no dependencies whatsoever, just enter the working directory of the project and type "node script.js" into your terminal.
A randomized but coherent performance report will be logged to the console.

### Technologies Used:
- JavaScript
- Git
- Kanban Board
